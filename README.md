# ESFM
Enhanced Standard Format Markers for Biblical resources

This is the home of ESFM: A community-enhanced version of [USFM](https://github.com/ubsicap/usfm) controlled by the United Bible Societies Institute for Computer Assisted Publishing ([UBSICAP](https://github.com/ubsicap)).

## Goals

1. To allow optional phrasing within a USFM source file. For example, if you want one set of files for two Bible variants that have either "Yahweh" or "the LORD" to be selectable on a website or before printing.
2. To allow pronoun referent tagging, e.g., to specify who "he" is in "He said,".
3. To allow semantic tagging, e.g., to specify that "Israel" is a "person" in one instance, but referring to "a nation" in another.
4. To allow alignment of translated words with original language words, e.g., "In the beginning" is the translation of the first word in the Hebrew Scriptures.

## History

ESFM was first conceived in 2014 (back in USFM 2 days). You can still read about the very early work [here](https://freely-given.org/Software/BibleDropBox/ESFMBibles.html).

## Involvement

Freely-Given welcomes the involvement of other interested parties.
